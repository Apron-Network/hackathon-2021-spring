# 未来 6 个月的商业规划

Most of the existing infrastructure services are deployed on cloud services. . The world's leading cloud service providers, such as AWS, Azure and AliCloud all have their own service markets. It is in these markets where service developers implement their own ideas and transfer these ideas into services and put them on the service market. These services are limited by the service market provided by cloud service providers. The services developed are then subjected to the auditing and supervision of cloud service providers, wherein the developers may lose the opportunity to provide services to users. Worse still, they may even lose the remuneration for providing services at any time due to the adjustment of service market policies of cloud service providers.

The construction of Apron Network enables infrastructure operators to provide their own infrastructure services to the public on Apron Network without  having to pay excessive maintenance costs.  Moreover, it will no longer be necessary for them to spend time on any related promotional or operational activities that may be required. It enables application developers to quickly discover and have access to various infrastructure services from the decentralized network on Apron Network without having to invest a lot of time and money to find infrastructure service solutions. It enables application users to use the applications based on decentralized infrastructure services without having to worry about the possible failure of using that infrastructure service. Apron Network allows all basic service providers, application developers and basic service users to cooperate safely and freely!

This means anyone can provide VPN services, face recognition, network storage, instant messaging and more through Apron Network without being restricted and regulated by a centralized business platform.

In the era of Web 3.0, the decentralized Apron Network, which belongs to the community, will replace the centralized infrastructure service platform controlled by commercial companies.It provides infrastructure services for developers, and gives everyone the freedom to explore the limitless potential of decentralization.

# 市场定位及调研

- 市场定位

As we move toward the fully decentralized future imagined by the creators of Web 3.0, we uncover the centralized artefacts of Web 2.0 on which we unfortunately still rely. Apron Labs has created the Apron Network to address and radically transform the foundational layer of this future by providing a decentralized infrastructure service network for DApp developers.

- 市场调研

Many projects have attempted to solve the issues  of blockchain infrastructure services, contributing  both centralized and decentralized solutions.

Infura provides API services for developers by building its own Ethereum and IPFS nodes, allowing developers to access Ethereum and IPFS node data through API services.

NOWNodes operates in a similar fashion to Infura, but provides more blockchain network API services. It claims to have provided 45 chain API services.

API3 constructed a public blockchain that provides an oracle network, governed in a  DAO structure with Kleros. By submitting an oracle to the data source provider, API3 builds the oracle network and provides cross-blockchain aggregation data for DApp.

BitQuery is a blockchain data engine that provides the data API on-chain to users by aggregating the blockchain data, BitQuery also provides simple data analysis capabilities and GraphQL API on the blockchain.

The Graph proposes a novel Ethereum and IPFS on-chain service index protocol. By using SubGraph’s definition, the index information is retrieved and established in the smart contract, and the GraphQL API is served for users to obtain the data information corresponding to the DApp.
